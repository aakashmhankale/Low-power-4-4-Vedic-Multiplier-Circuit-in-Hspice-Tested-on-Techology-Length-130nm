# Low-power-4-4-Vedic-Multiplier-Circuit-in-Hspice-Tested-on-Techology-Length-130nm
The need of high speed multiplier is increasing as the need of high speed processors are increasing. A Multiplier is one of the key hardware blocks in most fast processing system which is not only a high delay block but also a major source of power dissipation. A conventional processor requires substantially more hardware resources and processing time in the multiplication operation, rather than addition and subtraction. We are implementing a high speed 4x4 bit Vedic Multiplier (VM) based on Vertically &amp; Crosswise method of Vedic mathematics, a general multiplication formulae equally applicable to all cases of multiplication. It is based on generating all partial products and their sum in one step. The coding is done in HSPICE as well as simulation. The Power dissipation of 4x4 bit Vedic multiplier calculated as a baseline at 130nm technology node and compared with various low power techniques. We found that the in some techniques the delay is increasing but the power dissipation is reducing significantly. So we can use these circuits for power efficient devices.
